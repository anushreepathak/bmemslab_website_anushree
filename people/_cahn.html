        Dr. Ahn is now Distinguished University Research Professor and Mitchell P. Kartalia Endowed Chair Professor of Engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati.  He is currently Director of the Engineering Research Center (ERC) Clean Room and the Ohio Center for Microfluidic Innovation (OCMI, funded from the Ohio 3rd Frontier Wright Projects Program) at the University of Cincinnati.  Since joining the University of Cincinnati in 1994, he has successfully initiated and established an excellent Microfluidics and BioMEMS program (www.biomems.uc.edu) at the University of Cincinnati.  He is well recognized internationally as one of the pioneers in the BioMEMS, microfluidics, lab-on-a-chip (LOC) and point-of-care testing (POCT).  His research achievements from the BioMEMS and Microfluidic program at the University of Cincinnati has profoundly impacted over the advanced research and education in these areas. He is currently a Fellow at the Institute of Physics, and also a Fellow of the Graduate School of the University of Cincinnati.  Over the years at the University of Cincinnati, he has brought more than $20.0 M of research grants from DARPA, NSF, NIH, CDC, DOD, NASA, JPL and State of Ohio as PI or Co-PI.  He advised 26 PhD and 19 MS graduate students at the University of Cincinnati. His 12 former PhD students are currently tenured or tenure-track faculty at the Universities in US, Taiwan, and S. Korea, and his 14 former PhD students are now working in industries and national research institutes as a research scientist in US and S. Korea.</li>

        <p><font face="arial" size="4" color = "black">Research Impact</font></p>
        In specific, with the support of DARPA (MicroFlume Program) in 1997, his team had developed a new integrated microfluidic biochemical detection system for the analysis of bioterror agents [1]. The integrated system used a new on-chip magnetic bead-based sampling method. In addition, in 2000 with the support of DARPA (MicroFlip Program), for the first time his team had developed a new smart polymer lab-on-a-chip for the analysis of whole blood, which opened a new realm of disposable point-of-care testing (POCT) [2].  Furthermore, he had newly introduced and extensively explored Cyclic Olefin Copolymer (COC) as one of the most promising polymer materials for the polymer lab-on-a-chip.  COC is now used in most industries and academia working on polymer lab-on-a-chip [3].  His research on the new polymer lab-on-a-chips [1-3] and the fundamentals of microfluidics [4] gave a high impact over the life science and diagnostic community which was thirst for new platforms of POCT [5] desired for the analysis of proteins or DNA molecules in small volume. He has published over ~142 journal papers and ~ 219 peer-reviewed conference proceeding papers, and chaired numerous international conferences and steering committees.  In Google Scholar, he has around 16,450 citations and h-index of 62 as of April 2025.  He was invited as a plenary or keynote speaker from the numerous prestigious international conferences such as uTAS, Eurosensors, APCOT, or IEEE IEDM.  He is serving as one of the Scientific Advisory Board members of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on microfluidics and point-of-care testing diagnostics since 2016.<br>

Optimiser&trade; product, which was developed from Siloam Biosciences Inc., has been widely used in the industries for advanced immunoassays. The Optimiser&trade; products improves immunoassays through the power of microfluidics, dramatically improving immunoassay performance across a wide spectrum of measures.  His efforts for the commercialization have led him to have the University¡¯s Emerging Entrepreneur Award (2009) and Established Entrepreneur Award (2011) from the University of Cincinnati.  He has consulted many faculty/researchers and industries working on the commercialization of microfluidic devices and lab-on-a-chip toward in vitro diagnostics (IVD) products.<br>
        His key inventions and pioneering contributions includes (a) a new concept of ¡°Smart Polymer Lab-on-a-Chip¡± (U.S. Patent 7524464, 2009); (b) A new ¡°Microfluidic Assay Platforms¡± (U.S. Patent 9919311 B2, 2018) for the point-of-care testing (POCT) clinical diagnostics, and (c) a new concept of ¡°Lab-on-a-tube¡± (U.S. Patent 8628493, 2014) for the neurosurgical diagnostics of traumatic brain injury (TBI).</li>
