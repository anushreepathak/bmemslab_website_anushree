                             This course is designed for graduate students and senior undergraduate students in engineering, as well as Industry 4.0/5.0 students who are interested in sensors and sensor technologies. It is offered as an asynchronous online course on Canvas this semester. In this course, we will 
provide a comprehensive overview of sensors and their applications for smart systems, 
internet of things (IoT), mobile networks, and healthcare. Fundamental principles and 
technologies for a variety of sensors will be introduced and discussed in this course, 
which includes design, analysis, implementation, signal conditioning, and instrumentation of sensors in engineering practices. Applications of electrical, physical, chemical and biomedical sensors for environmental monitoring, automobiles, aerospace, healthcare, IoT, etc. will be covered. Due to the breadth of course content, this course is taught by multiple instructors on their topics of expertise. Please see the course schedule for more information.</font></div>
