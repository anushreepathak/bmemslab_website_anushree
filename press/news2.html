            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">UC's Microsystems and BioMEMS Laboratory at the Center for 
            Microelectronic Sensors and MEMS (CMSM) is attracting millions of 
            dollars in federal funding and attention from researchers around the 
            world, but the projects coming out of the lab are even more amazing. 
            Working with major corporations and other high-tech universities, 
            College of Engineering researchers are on the verge of developing a 
            wristwatch-like device that can monitor everything from a patient in 
            intensive care to a wounded soldier on a distant battlefield, using 
            disposable smart plastic biochips. <BR><BR><IMG align=right

            science and director of the Microsystems and BioMEMS Lab. "UC has 
            made the greatest strides. It's one of the most successful programs 
            in the country," alongside MIT, Stanford, the University of Michigan 
            and UC-Berkeley. Ahn said UC engineers are making a strong impact in 
            three areas involving MEMS technology, which stands for 
            micro-electromechanical systems:</font>

            research directors at the National Science Foundation and elsewhere 
            documenting that his novel inventions and excellent publications 
            "put UC on the map" in the rapidly growing MEMS and BioMEMS fields.

            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">Ahn is a leader at numerous international conferences on BioMEMS 
            and MEMS, where he has demonstrated how to make micro biochips out 
            of plastic. That research has moved forward quickly and is now 
            focusing on the development of a wristwatch-like device to monitor 
            blood chemistry.</font> 
            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">"There is no pain in blood sampling," he notes. That's because 
            microscopic needles made of biodegradable plastic materials are used 
            to quickly pierce the skin and retrieve the tiny amount of blood 
            needed for analysis. The analysis uses "smart, plastic biochips," 
            which are extremely sensitive, inexpensive, disposable and fast.</font> 
            <P><font face="Arial" size="2"><B>"We can analyze almost anything in 10-20 seconds with a tiny 
            drop of blood,"</B> said Ahn. Traditional lab tests can take hours 
            with the blood sample using a big syringe, and patients often wait 
            days for results. Collaborators include researchers at Ohio State 
            University, Louisiana State University, Meridian Diagnostics Inc. 
            and CFD-RC. <BR><BR><IMG align=right alt="device design"

            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the novel features of the system is the way it reduces 
            energy consumption by using a pressured air or liquid on a biochip, 
            as an alternative power to electronic batteries. Tiny bubbles in the 
            biochips are "popped," releasing a blast of air in a sequence to run 
            the various channels, mixers, incubators, sensors and valves 
            required for analysis on a chip. Since the biochips are disposable, 
            it doesn't matter that the bubbles burst. Just pop in a new chip, 
            and you're ready to run the next series of tests.</font> 
            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is funding 
            the project in hopes of being able to get a quick read on the 
            condition of soldiers wounded in battle or of various clinical 
            screening and diagnostic applications. "The army would be able to 
            monitor a soldier's condition during the operation. Is he going into 
            shock due to bleeding or respiratory difficulty? You could judge by 
            the biochips with remote communication."</font> 
            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">Because the basic technology has been worked out, the monitor 
            could easily be adapted to check for a number of different compounds 
            including lactate, glucose, carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the 
            blood, including detection of infectious diseases using immunoassay. 
            That means the wristband monitor could be used as a point-care 
            system in hospitals or to monitor outpatients.</font> 
            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">Ahn's progress has been so remarkable that he has been invited to 
            over 15 international meetings in addition to invited talks at top 
            U.S. labs. He says the "real success story" though is the number of 
            engineering graduate students succeeding in the new field of 
            BioMEMS. They have produced nearly 100 papers in some of the world's 
            top journals and major international conferences in MEMS and 
            BioMEMS, including one U.S. patent issued and eight U.S. patents 
            pending. After earning their degrees, they have gone to positions at 
            AT&amp;T Bell Labs, Motorola, Samsung and new biotech start-up 
            companies.</font> 
            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, he has been extensively working on the development 
            of "lab-on-a-chip" using glass or plastic substrates to detect and 
            analyze bio-molecules such as specific proteins and/or antigens in 
            liquid samples. The methodology and system, which has been developed 
            on disposable plastic substrates, can be also applied to generic 
            bio-molecule detection and analysis systems with appropriate bio 
            receptors/reagents such as DNA fragments or oligonucleotides for 
            genomic analysis and/or high throughput protein analysis.</font> 
            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">He is now working with several medical doctors and cell 
            biologists from the UC College of Medicine for applying the 
            disposable plastic or glass biochips to genomics and proteomics 
            research, including cell-based biochips. His lab and the CMSM are 
            now fully equipped to fabricate micro- or nano- structures for 
            biochips and BioMEMS devices using plastic, glass and silicon 
            substrates. Specifically, his recent DARPA project allows his lab to 
            be equipped with state-of-the-art plastic micromachining tools such 
            as a micro molder fabrication system, a micro plastic 
            injection-molding system, a plastic embossing system, a wafer 
            aligning and bonding system, a laser micromachining system, a 
            plastic surface analyzer and more.</font> 
            <P><font face="Arial" size="2">It's even possible that some of the inventive work done in the 
            College of Engineering will spawn a new biotech company through the 
            initiatives of the Office of Intellectual Property. But Ahn is quick 
            to acknowledge the ideas and efforts of his fellow engineering 
            faculty members, which includes electrical engineering's Joseph 
            Nevin, who has worked on circuit designs, and Gregory Beaucage in 
            material science and engineering, who has developed the polymers 
            required for the plastic biochips. Both are co-PIs on the 
            DARPA-funded project, which will be performed for the next three 
            years.</font> 
            <P><B><font face="Arial" size="2">"This is one of the most successful examples of teamwork at 
            UC," said Ahn. "The success is not mine alone. It's an 
            interdisciplinary collaboration with many partners throughout the 
            University of Cincinnati."</font></B>
