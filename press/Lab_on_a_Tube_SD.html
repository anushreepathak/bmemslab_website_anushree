<P id=first><SPAN class=date>ScienceDaily (May 5, 2009)</SPAN> — The need for 
improved monitoring of neurotrauma patients has resulted in the development of a 
prototype of a novel, multitasking “lab on a tube” at the University of 
Cincinnati (UC).</P>

<P>UC engineers, working to fill a need expressed by physicians at the 
Neurotrauma Center at the UC Neuroscience Institute, have developed a 
preliminary working model of the multimodal tube, or “smart sensor,” which is 
capable of continuously monitoring multiple physiological parameters in 
patients. The tube also is capable of draining excess cerebrospinal fluid from 
the injured brain and could be used to deliver medications to the patient.</P>
<P>Although the monitoring device is not yet ready for testing in humans, UC 
researchers hailed it as “a groundbreaking start.”</P>
<P>Raj Narayan, MD, chairman and Frank Mayfield professor in the department of 
neurosurgery and the project’s principal investigator, and Lori Shutter, MD, 
director of neurocritical care, expressed the need for a multimodality 
monitoring device for neurotrauma patients and participated in its design and 
creation.</P>
<P>The prototype for a smart neuro-catheter was then engineered by Chunyan Li, 
PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the UC department of neurosurgery who trained 
under Chong Ahn, PhD, professor in the department of electrical and computer 
engineering. Concepts for a “lab on a tube” device with multimodality sensors 
were developed in the Microsystems and BioMEMS Laboratory headed by Ahn.</P>
<P>“It’s a great story of collaboration and multidisciplinary effort at UC,” Ahn 
says.</P>
<P>The tube is under provisional patent application and which should be ready 
for testing in an animal model within the next few months.</P>
<P>“Clinical monitoring is poised for exciting advances,” Narayan says. “When we 
can track what is going on in a patient’s brain tissue, or blood, on a 
continuous basis, we can treat the patient much more promptly and effectively. 
We hope to revolutionize the field.”</P>
<P>Traumatic brain injury, the result of a fall or impact, is typically followed 
by a wave of secondary injury caused by swelling, increased intracranial 
pressure, reduced blood flow to the brain, lack of oxygen, too much or too 
little glucose and increased temperature. Because medical science has yet to 
invent medicines capable of preventing or reducing secondary injury, physicians 
strive to maximize recovery by maintaining optimal conditions for healing.</P>
<P>The smart sensor could benefit patients through real-time monitoring, as 
opposed to intermittent monitoring, which is the current standard of care and 
which reveals undesirable changes after they have occurred. The promise of 
real-time monitoring from the multimodality tube would enhance care by allowing 
changes to be identified instantly.</P>
<P>The “lab on a tube” also reduces from two to one the number of holes that 
must be drilled into the skull for the insertion of sensors. The tube’s diameter 
also can be expanded or contracted as necessary, thereby improving safety.</P>
<P>“Currently, advanced neuromonitoring requires placement of multiple devices,” 
Shutter says. “The ability to gather all information from one system has 
significant potential to increase our ability to manage patients who are 
critically ill from neurological conditions.”</P>
<P>The spirally rolled device can simultaneously monitor intracranial glucose, 
oxygen, temperature and pressure, and it can be modified in the future to 
monitor other parameters as well. It has sensors inside the tube, where they can 
measure the biochemistry of cerebrospinal fluid, as well as on the outside, 
where they can measure changes within the brain tissue. The original prototype, 
11 centimeters in length and 1.7 millimeters in diameter, is already evolving 
into an even smaller, more sophisticated tube.</P>
<P>The placement of a single, ultra-thin catheter benefits patients through 
reduced risk. Li adds that placing a single catheter also would be more 
economical.</P>
<P>Also contributing to the tube’s development were Pei-Ming Wu and WooSeok Jung 
of the Microsystems and BioMEMS Laboratory in UC’s department of electrical and 
computer engineering.</P>
<P>The work was supported by the Integra Lifesciences Foundation, based in 
Plainsboro, N.J. Narayan&nbsp;has served on Integra LifeSciences’ scientific advisory 
board in the past but is not currently a member; Shutter has served in the past 
on the company’s speakers bureau. Neither has any financial interest in Integra 
LifeSciences.</P>
