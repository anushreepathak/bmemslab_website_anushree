          <i>ASME NEWS</i><br>
          <br>
          <font size="+2">A</font>SME's annual MEMS Technology Seminar is scheduled 
          to take place June 17-19 at the Hyatt Regency in Cambridge, Mass.<br>
          <br>
          The seminar is for mechanical engineers and researchers, chemical engineers 
          and chemists, electrical engineers, government and private laboratoriezs, 
          manufacturers, research and development firms, as well as investment 
          and financial executives. <br>
          <br>
          During the seminar, four courses will be offered: BioMEMS, MEMS Packaging, 
          Microfluidics and Lab on a Chip, and Photonics. A brief outline of each 
          course follows.<br>
          In BioMEMS, attendees will gain an in-depth understanding of biomedical 
          MEMS. The course will begin with an introduction to the microelectromechanical 
          field and a tutorial on the fundamentals of MEMS device fabrication. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Attendees will get detailed insight into bioMEMS and the unique features 
          of these micromachines in terms of design, materials and fabrication 
          techniques. Specific application areas will also be covered in detail, 
          such as implantable drug delivery, biomimetic interfaces, tissue engineering 
          and microsurgical tools. <br>
          <br>
          The commercialization of bioMEMS will also be discussed, along with 
          the biocompatibility aspects of bioMEMS, systems integration issues 
          and future directions of the field.<br>
          <br>
          The course directors are Abraham Lee, a professor at the Center for 
          Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Irvine, and Gisela 
          Lin, a sales engineer with the BioMEMS Business Unit of Standard MEMS 
          Inc.<br>
          <br>
          The MEMS Packaging course will provide basic and advanced packaging 
          topics and solutions for various MEMS devices. An overview of MEMS manufacturing 
          technologies and related packaging issues will be given at the beginning 
          of the course. <br>
          <br>
          Specific MEMS packaging requirements and solutions for key MEMS commercial 
          products <br>
          will then be addressed by experienced researchers from various industry 
          sectors.<br>
          <br>
          Hermetical sealing, accelerated testing and vacuum encapsulation skills 
          will also be discussed in this course, along with advanced approaches 
          for MEMS packaging and assembly, integration issues and future directions.<br>
          <br>
          The course director will be Liwei Lin, an associate professor of mechanical 
          engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. <br>
          <br>
        <b>
          Although Microfluidics is an enabling technology that can have a strong 
          impact on biochemical analysis on chips, researchers need to understand 
          the behaviors of fluid flow in nano/micro channels, which differ greatly 
          from the macro scale. <br>
          <br>
          This course will cover the fundamentals of microfluidics for beginners 
          to the applications of microfluidics for end users. Course participants 
          will learn designing, modeling, fabricating and characterizing microfluidic 
          components. That will be followed by training in the application of 
          fundamental concepts of microfluidics to practical lab-on-a-chip, DNA/ 
          protein chips and clinical diagnostic biochips. <br>
          <br>

          Chong H. Ahn</font>, who is director of <font color="#CC0000"> microsystems and bioMEMS at the University 
          of Cincinnati</font>, will be the course director.</b> <br>
          <br>
          Although microelectronic and photonic packaging typically involves electrical 
          and optical engineers, mechanical and materials engineers can be equally 
          successful in both fields, once they learn how to apply methods of mechanical 
          and materials engineering to this area and understand the mechanical 
          and reliability problems encountered in microelectronics and photonics. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Upon completing the Photonics and Lab on a Chip course, participants 
          will be able to better understand the reliability problems in, and mechanical 
          behavior of, typical microelectronics, optoelectronics and photonics 
          structures subjected to thermally induced, mechanical or dynamic loading. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The course will provide simple and easy-to-apply formulas that can be 
          used during the design process. These formulas indicate the roles of 
          different materials and geometrical factors affecting the mechanical 
          behavior and reliability of a packaging structure, and can be effectively 
          used prior to, and often instead of, computer-aided modeling or experimental 
          analyses. <br>
          <br>
          Ephraim Suhir, who is a vice president of reliability and packaging 
          at Iolon Inc., and the founder and editor-in-chief of ASME's Journal 
          of Electronic Packaging, will be the course director. <br>
          <br>
          All courses begin at 8:30 a.m. and end at 4:30 p.m., except Photonics, 
          which begins at 8 a.m. A daily luncheon is included. <br>
          <br>
          The per-course cost to attend is $1,295 for members and $1,445 for nonmembers. 
          The cost will be $1,095 for members who are academics and $1,245 for 
          nonmember academics. <br>
